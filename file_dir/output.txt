1 - Your full name and address in the United States of America - My name is Nukri Orbeladze 2 - Which country are you a citizen of?
- I am a citizen of Georgia.
Kutaisi city, Zviad Gamsakhurdia N 42.20 b.
8 Floor 3 - Why are you asking for asylum, who persecuted you and why?
My life is in danger.
In my country, Georgia, I have no guarantee that they won't kill me.
I will be persecuted and eliminated by a criminal group that has negotiated with the Georgian authorities.
My case is related to the case of illegal call centers operating in Georgia (call centers in Georgia are companies that are disguised as different businesses and in fact they trick citizens of different countries around the world, people of a more vulnerable age, into money and savings in supposedly profitable businesses.
These call centers actually own people's money) The owners of the criminal call centers suspected that I was providing information about this illegal activity to the representatives of the opposition parties who were exposing the people involved in this illegal business in the mass media.
4 - When and how did your problems start?
My main problems started in March 2022, when the owners of the call center suspected me that I was providing information about their activities to the representatives of the opposition party, and the most influential groups in Georgia and their patrons intended to eliminate me.
I started repair work in this company in February 2022, in two months I encountered such problems that radically changed my fate.
